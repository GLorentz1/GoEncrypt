CRITICAL
- Need to cancel multipart uploads when upload is blocked by file limits or by error

HIGH
- Improve other endpoints error handling

MEDIUM
- Standardize error treatment in code (some places use log.fatal, others use log.print, others return http.errors)

LOW
- Rate-limit requests somehow (maybe IP addresses?)
[DONE] Head file before generating download link (that way we can check if the upload has finished)
